# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis Project

An end-to-end data analysis project using **Power BI**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** to explore and understand passenger survival patterns aboard the RMS Titanic. This project applies both exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques to generate insights from the Titanic dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to perform **data-driven survival analysis** of Titanic passengers and identify key factors that influenced survival, such as:

- Gender
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Age Group
- Fare
- Embarkation point
- Combined demographic attributes

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool         | Purpose                                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **SQL**      | Data cleaning, transformation, querying    |
| **Excel**    | Initial EDA, pivot tables, basic charts    |
| **Power BI** | Interactive dashboards and visualization   |
| **Python**   | Jupyter Notebook for in-depth analysis     |

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset is derived from the **Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning Challenge** and includes information such as:

- Passenger ID
- Survival Status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Passenger Class (1, 2, 3)
- Name, Sex, Age
- Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard
- Fare, Cabin, Embarked location

---

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

### 🔹 SQL Analysis Highlights
- **Survival Rate by Gender**: Females had significantly higher survival rates (~74%) compared to males (~18%).
- **Survival Rate by Class**: First class passengers had the highest survival rate.
- **Age Group Insights**: Children had higher survival rates than adults and seniors.
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Cross-tab analysis of age, class, and gender combinations revealed nuanced trends.

### 🔹 Python Notebook Insights
- Data cleaning and imputation (handling missing values).
- Visualization using seaborn/matplotlib for correlation and distribution analysis.
- Feature engineering: Age group bucketing, family size calculation.

### 🔹 Excel Findings
- Quick survival breakdowns using pivot tables and conditional formatting.
- Filtering by embarked location and fare categories for pattern recognition.

### 🔹 Power BI Dashboard
- Interactive report showing survival distribution by:
  - Gender
  - Age Group
  - Class
  - Embarked port
  - Combined filters (Gender + Class + Age)
- Slicers for user-friendly dynamic exploration.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Gender** was the most influential survival factor; women had over **4x** higher survival odds than men.
- **First-class passengers** had significantly better survival chances than those in second or third class.
- **Children and teens** had moderately better survival outcomes than middle-aged and elderly passengers.
- **Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (C)** had the highest survival rate, possibly due to class distribution.
- **Fare amount** was positively correlated with survival, indicating socioeconomic influence.

## ✅ Conclusion

This project showcases a **multi-tool, data storytelling approach** to solving real-world problems. By combining SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI, the project provides layered insights, from raw data querying to professional dashboarding—making it a well-rounded portfolio piece for aspiring data analysts and business intelligence professionals.
